🚀 Vanilla JS Quiz Application
A dynamic, responsive Quiz Application built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This project demonstrates core web development concepts including DOM manipulation, state management, and event handling.

🌟 Key Features
Dynamic UI: Questions and answers are rendered dynamically from a data object.

State Tracking: Tracks user score and progress throughout the 10-question quiz.

Responsive Design: Modern, mobile-friendly interface with custom-styled radio inputs.

Validation: Prevents users from skipping questions by ensuring an answer is selected.

Final Results: Summarizes performance at the end of the session.

🛠️ Technical Highlights
DOM Manipulation: Creating and appending elements (document.createElement) to keep the HTML "clean."

Array Methods: Used .forEach() to iterate through quiz data and answers.

Selection Logic: Implemented document.querySelector with CSS pseudo-classes (:checked) to capture user input.

DRY Principles: Centralized the question-loading logic into a reusable search() function.
